I am Luke Gruszka. Yes, for some reason I loved the name Zyphr so you will see some accounts with that alias incorporated.

Currently, I work as Discover's Senior Scrum Master, enabling data science technologies for our company by using Scrum and JIRA. I have a degree in Business Information Systems from Illinois State University and also, I am in the process of earning my Masters of Science degree in Data Science. This website is all about my work that I have done in the Data Science field.

Do I know what I am doing? No not at all by I find that if I hit refresh a couple of times I will find the answer.
