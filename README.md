Today we are faced with a virus that is rapidly spreading and affecting everyone across the world. While the world governments are taking action and implementing safety procedures; we still see that the virus is spreading. This draws the questions if these actions are preventing the spread or simply just stalling the spread. The data being collected will give me the option to be able to see when the virus will be predicted to end and if the safety measurements being taken are actually slowing down the spread for the virus. By using linear regression I will be able to map out the trajectory of the virus. Also, I will be able to use a time series to map out when certain safety precautions have been taken and what effects those actions have on the virus outbreak.
