## Statistical/Hypothetical Question
Summer weekends at night are the most dangerous in Boston.

## Outcome of EDA
The outcome was that parts of the hypothesis was correct. The Summer had a great probability of having crimes being committed. The weekends although did have a greater number of crimes being committed was second to the end of the week being Friday. Friday is when the majority of people are done with work for the weekend and also that schools gets out. This will allow for more people to be roaming around and increase the risk of a crime to happen. Then nights were also somewhat correct in the fact that around the time people were getting off work was the most times crimes were committed. This is when the most amount of people were out and thus increased the probability of the
crimes being committed.

## What did I feel was missed during the analysis?
 I feel the age groups were missing in my analysis. If there was an age group present and could then track a correlation between the type of people committing the crimes. As I mentioned above the time, month, and the days were all relevant to the school being let out and people not being in work. There could be a direct correlation or causation of the data presented.

## Were there any variables I felt could have helped in the analysis?
The variables that could have helped was the age group and the names of the places
these were taking place at. The time and day showed that it was the end of a work week during happy hour. I can make the assumption that people were out and about and allowed for a higher probability of the crimes being committed. With a higher amount of people roaming around allows for more opportunities for crimes to appear.

## Were there any assumptions made I felt were incorrect?
Some assumptions that might be incorrect was that there was a correlation between the summer months and the type of crimes committed. It could be a causation between the more relevance that more crimes are being committed. When more crimes are being committed there is a higher probability that a more serious crime will be committed.

## What challenges did I face, what did I did not fully understand?
Some of the challenges that I faced with that the data lacked some variables that really could have helped the conversation between the correlations. I see that using the data I had I had to make some assumptions from the outcomes I was receiving. I did not fully understand the full layout of the city. I think with more data I would have been able to locate certain locations of the city. Perhaps the locations of the crimes happening in the city would be able to tell a better story of the crimes than just h
