With this project I did not run into many issues. I picked a very hot topic as Global Warming. Majority of the sources that I viewed had well groomed data. The benefits of picking a hot topic is that the data is usually easy to find and well groomed ahead of time. The data fits all the criteria that was required for this project. All data is evenly distributed and can be combined using many different keys in the data. I did not have to remove any duplicates and the data had no outliers. I think majority of that success goes to the sources of which I choose to use. Kaggle and Data.gov are reputable sources that allow for the data to be ready to be used. The data sets are using the locations and are easy to track because all data sets relate to a location that can be used when graphing data. Heat maps will be an easy way to track the analysis. All data has been imported through a readable format and also a usable format that no further transformation was needed.
